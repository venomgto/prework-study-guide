bootcamp prework study guide

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a study guide for people who are new to coding. By creating this study guide it is my hope people who are struggling or need help learning the basics. Will use this a refernce in they're learning and help them with there journey in coding. The problem it solved was provide people with basic knowledge on the 3 fundamental languages for coding. It helped me a lot with getting familiar with these 3 languages and understanding them. I learned about html, css and javascript. Each one helps build a website from html which is the foundation. To CSS which us give our website some style. To the last one JavaScript which helps let people interact with out website.

For this website we have certian sections that focus on the 3 core values of what we learned for our study guide. I also provided some notes in bullet points for the reader to see what each language does, and how they help each other make a functioning website. Also if you open DevTools, you can see what we wrote for JavaScript. It helps you pick a subject to get started on your learning journey. Remeber you can come back and refer to this study guide if you are new to coding or just new a refresher.
